* The "**Diagrams**"" folder contains diagrams to show how our system build will work.
* Figures and references can be found in the respective "**Figures**" and "**References**" directories.
* Research conducted to create the final solution document and the build is contained in the "**Technical Design Research**" directory.
* The "**Assets**" folder contains all logos, images, or otherwise promotional material created.
